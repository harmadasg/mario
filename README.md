# Coding a 2D Game Engine in Java

This project is based on the YouTube series [Coding a 2D Game Engine in Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyKE7vz65rY&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE "Coding a 2D Game Engine in Java") by GamesWithGabe. The primary motivation is mainly to learn about the internal mechanisms and components of a game engine and to gain insights into the realm of game development.
The end product itself resembles the classic NES game, Super Mario Bros. from 1985.
